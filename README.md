# password generator

This project generates a random password after answering some prompts for the specifications of what needs to be in the password. When clicking the generate password button it will prompt the user asking if they want to include upercase letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. It will also ask to for the desired length of the password in a range from 8 to 128. If the number is not within the range it will default to 8 as the length. 

The hmtl and css files were already written while the javascript file was made by me.
